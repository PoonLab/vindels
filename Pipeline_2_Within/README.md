## Within Host Analysis

This repository contains an assortment of Python, Bash, and R scripts used to perform a phylogenetic analysis of gp120 indels using longitudinally-sampled HIV-1 sequence data.

Objectives:
1) Download gp120 sequence data from LANL from within-host HIV-1 sequence data
2) Perform pairwise alignment of each patient sequence with HXB2 (reference) to extract the gp120 variable regions
3) Perform a MSA between all sequences within each host 
4) Generate phylogenetic trees using Bayesian Inference (implemented using BEAST software package)
5) Apply an ancestral reconstruction method to extract insertion and deletion sequences from data 
6) Estimate the rates, lengths, and compositions of indels in each gp120 variable region using past pipeline
