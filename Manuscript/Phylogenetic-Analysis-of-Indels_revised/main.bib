	Abstract = {Evolutionary constraint for insertions and deletions (indels) is not necessarily equal to constraint for nucleotide substitutions for any given region of a genome. Knowing the variation in indel-specific evolutionary rates across the sequence will aid our understanding of evolutionary constraints on indels, and help us infer how indels have contributed to the evolution of the sequence. However, unlike for nucleotide substitutions, there has been no phylogenetic method that can statistically infer significantly different rates of indels across the sequence space independent of substitution rates. Here, we have developed a software that will find sites with accelerated evolutionary rates specific to indels, by introducing a scaling parameter that only applies to the indel rates and not to the nucleotide substitution rates. Using the software, we show that we can find regions of accelerated rates of indels in the protein alignments of primate genomes. We also confirm that the sites that have high rates of indels are different from the sites that have high rates of nucleotide substitutions within the protein sequences. By identifying regions with accelerated rates of indels independent of nucleotide substitutions, we will be able to better understand the impact of indel mutations on protein sequence evolution.},

Is AIDS essentially an autoimmune disease, triggering apoptosis, or is virus infection the cause of T helper lymphocyte depletion? What is the significance of HIV tropism and the role of macrophages and dendritic cells in AIDS? Is there viral latency and why is there usually a long period between infection and AIDS? Is HIV variation a crucial aspect of its pathogenesis and, if so, do virulent strains emerge? Although this article provides few definitive answers, it aims to focus commentary on salient points. Overall, it is increasingly evident that both the tropism and burden of HIV infection correlate closely with the manifestations of disease.},

	Abstract = {The human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) and 2 (HIV-2) are enveloped RNA viruses that are members of the genus Lentivirus and the family Retroviridae. HIV-1 is further divided into four groups; three of these originated from chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus and are designated group M (major)---responsible for the majority of the worldwide epidemic, group O (outlier), and group N (nonmajor and nonoutlier). Each group phylogenetically correlates with three separate transmission events ( 1 ). The fourth, group P, has been recently identified and is closely related to a gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus ( 2 ). Within group M there are nine different subtypes and more than 40 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), which together lead to enormous viral genetic diversity. This variability plays an important role in the design and interpretation of viral load and resistance assays, and it provides clues to epidemiology and transmission of HIV-1. HIV-2 is a much smaller epidemic than HIV-1 and has its origins in simian immunodeficiency virus sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) with at least eight distinct transmissions to humans. Correct diagnosis of HIV-1 versus HIV-2 is critical as there are distinct differences in response to antiretroviral therapy.},

@article{Vasan:2006,
	Abstract = {Background. Many different subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 have been identified, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. However, much remains unknown regarding the relative pathogenicity of these subtypes and their influence on the clinical progression of HIV infection. We examined prospectively the associations between HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D and recombinant viruses, as well as the rates of disease progression in a cohort of seropositive women from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods. A total of 428 pregnant mothers participating in a larger controlled trial of the effect of vitamin supplements were selected for DNA sequencing of their HIV-1 subtype. Plasma viral load was measured at baseline, and CD4⁺ cell counts was assessed at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the follow-up period. Proportional hazards regression (hazards ratio [HR]) analysis was used to measure the association between viral subtype and the rate of disease progression. Results. Relative to patients with subtype A, patients with subtype D experienced the most rapid progression to death (HR, 2.27; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-3.52) or to the World Health Organization stage 4 of illness (HR, 1.94; 95\% CI, 1.20-3.14) and to a CD4⁺ cell count of {\textless}200 cells/mm³ (HR, 2.12; 95\% CI, 1.42-3.17). After adjustment for viral load, CD4⁺ cell count, and other baseline covariates, the associations remained similar. Conclusions. We observed heterogeneity in the rates of disease progression of HIV-1 disease in infected persons, on the basis of the infecting subtype. Subtype D was associated with the most rapid progression of the disease, relative to the other 3 categories of viruses in our cohort.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of proviral gp120 during the first year after seroconversion in HIV-1 subtype C infection was addressed in a case series of eight subjects. Multiple viral variants were found in two out of eight cases. Slow rate of viral RNA decline and high early viral RNA set point were associated with a higher level of proviral diversity from 0 to 200 days after seroconversion. Proviral divergence from MRCA over the same period also differed between subjects with slow and fast decline of viral RNA, suggesting that evolution of proviral gp120 early in infection may be linked to the level of viral RNA replication. Changes in the length of variable loops were minimal, and length reduction was more common than length increase. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites ranged $\pm$one site, showing common fluctuations in the V4 and V5 loops. These results highlight the role of proviral gp120 diversity and diversification in the pathogenesis of acute HIV-1 subtype C infection.},

@article{Li:1988,
	Abstract = {The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by a retrovirus called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has become a pandemic. A knowledge of the rate of nucleotide substitution in HIV and of the history and pattern of spread of the virus is important for understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS and for developing therapies and vaccine strategies. A new model has been developed and used to estimate the substitution rates in various regions in the HIV genome. The rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) substitution is lowest in the regions coding for the capsid proteins and the reverse transcriptase, being approximately 1.7 X 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The nonsynonymous rate is extremely high (14 X 10(-3] in the hypervariable regions of the envelope gene, suggesting extremely rapid change in viral antigenicity. The nonsynonymous rates in the other coding regions are between 3 X 10(-3) and 7 X 10(-3). The average synonymous rate for the HIV genome is 10 X 10(-3). These rates are 10(6) times greater than the rates in DNA genomes and at least as high as the rates in other RNA viruses. Evidence is provided for a case of recombination between different HIV strains. Our analysis suggests that the AIDS virus had existed in central Africa before 1960 and spread to North America before the mid 1970s. The evolutionary relationships among HIV isolates are inferred from nucleotide sequence data, and the result is consistent with the view that AIDS spread from Haiti to the United States.},

@article{Anderson:2001,
	Abstract = {. Phylogenetic analyses frequently rely on models of sequence evolution that detail nucleotide substitution rates, nucleotide frequencies, and site-to-site rate heterogeneity. These models can influence hypothesis testing and can affect the accuracy of phylogenetic inferences. Maximum likelihood methods of simultaneously constructing phylogenetic tree topologies and estimating model parameters are computationally intensive, and are not feasible for sample sizes of 25 or greater using personal computers. Techniques that initially construct a tree topology and then use this non-maximized topology to estimate ML substitution rates, however, can quickly arrive at a model of sequence evolution. The accuracy of this two-step estimation technique was tested using simulated data sets with known model parameters. The results showed that for a star-like topology, as is often seen in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B sequences, a random starting topology could produce nucleotide substitution rates that were not statistically different than the true rates. Samples were isolated from 100 HIV-1 subtype B infected individuals from the United States and a 620 nt region of the env gene was sequenced for each sample. The sequence data were used to obtain a substitution model of sequence evolution specific for HIV-1 subtype B env by estimating nucleotide substitution rates and the site-to-site heterogeneity in 100 individuals from the United States. The method of estimating the model should provide users of large data sets with a way to quickly compute a model of sequence evolution, while the nucleotide substitution model we identified should prove useful in the phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 subtype B env sequences.},

	Abstract = {In this study we have characterized intra-patient length polymorphism in V4 by cloning and sequencing a C2-C4 fragment from HIV plasma RNA in patients at different stages of HIV disease. Clonal analysis of clade B, G, and CRF02 isolates during early infection shows extensive intra-patient V4 variability, due to the presence of indel-associated polymorphism. Indels, coupled to amino acid substitution events, affect the number and distribution of potential N-glycosylation sites, resulting in the coexistence, within the same patient, of V4 subsets, each characterized by different sizes, amino acid sequences, and potential N-glycosylation patterns. In contrast, V3 appears to be relatively homogeneous, with similar V3 associated to significantly different V4 within the same clinical specimen. Based on these data, we propose that during early chronic infection V4 is present as a highly divergent quasispecies, enabling the virus to adopt different conformational structures according to immune constrains and other selective pressures.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A lower virulence of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) is suggested to be related to the global dominance of HIV-1C. In this observational study, combining in vivo (clinical monitoring) and in vitro (genotypic, biochemical, and phenotypic assays), we explored whether HIV-1C from East Africa (HIV-1CEA ) is more pathogenic due to the evolution of a PYxE-insertion (CPYxEi ) in the gag-p6 that also could affect the therapy response.
METHODS: HIV-1B (n = 112) and HIV-1CEA (n = 128)-infected individuals residing in Sweden were analyzed with regard to Gag-p6 genotype and clinically monitored. Based on the Gag-p6 characteristics, three HIV-1CEA and one HIV-1 B patient-derived p2-INT-recombinant virus (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) were constructed to analyze viral growth kinetics (VGKs) and drug sensitivity assays. Reverse transcriptase (RT) from the same samples was cloned into the heterodimer expression plasmid (pRT6H-PROT) to analyze catalytic efficiency of RT.
RESULTS: A higher viral failure rate and lower pre-therapy CD4+ T-cell counts were observed in HIV-1CEA -infected patients compared to HIV-1B-infected patients. In Gag-p6, PTAP-duplication was more common in HIV-1C. HIV-1CEA -infected patients with signature CPYxEi, evidenced very low pre-therapy CD4+ T-cell counts and suboptimal gain in CD4+ T-cells following therapy, as compared to the non-CPYxEi -strains indicating higher virulence. VGKs showed a statistically significant higher replication capacity (RC) for the CPYxEi viruses than the other two non-CPYxEi strains. No statistically significant difference was observed in the catalytic efficiency among HIV-1C RTs.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of polymerase independent increased virulence and RC in HIV-1CEA following PYxE-insertion that is associated with suboptimal CD4+ T-cell gain following therapy initiation. J. Med. Virol. 89:106-111, 2017. {\copyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We report on the properties of a set of HIV-1 IIIB Env mutants carrying a linear gp41 epitope insertion (LLELDKWASL) in the V1, V2, V3 or V4 variable loop. Insertion of the epitope, which is defined by the HIV-1 neutralizing MAb 2F5, was well tolerated in the V1, V2 and V4 loops, as these mutants were properly expressed, retained reactivity to conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies and exhibited patterns similar to the parental Env molecule. However, insertion of this epitope in the V3 loop was associated with drastically reduced protein expression. Relative to parental Env molecule, the V1, V2 and V4 insertion mutants demonstrated significantly increased binding to mAb 2F5 in vitro. To evaluate immunogenicity, mice and guinea pigs were immunized with plasmid expression vectors for the mutant proteins. For both mice and guinea pigs, all four mutants elicited anti-gp120 antibody responses. In mice the V1 and V3 insertion mutants, but neither the V2 or V4 insertion mutant nor the parental env, elicited significant titers against the epitope peptide, whereas in guinea pigs, V2 insertion mutant was most effective in eliciting anti-2F5 peptide antibody responses. While original V2 2F5 insertion mutant failed to elicit anti-2F5 peptide responses in mice, studies with 14 additional V2 insertion mutants revealed several insertion sites at which the epitope was able to induce epitope-specific antibody responses. This indicates that the precise position at which the epitope insertion takes place dictates the ability of the mutant to induce the epitope-specific antibody responses. When tested for virus neutralization activity, the guinea pig sera that contain high titers of anti-2F5 peptide antibody failed to enhance the virus neutralizing activity, suggesting that the configuration of 2F5 epitope plays a critical role in inducing neutralizing antibody responses. The results from this study may have potential implications with respect to modification of the HIV-1 Env molecule for the purpose of improving HIV-1 Env immunogenicity.},

@article{Marlowe:2004,
	Abstract = {Sequence variation in the gag p6 region in subtype B HIV-1 has been associated with changes in viral replication capacity and antiretroviral drug susceptibility. We examined sequence variation in the HIV-1 gag p6 region using plasma samples from 22 individuals with non-subtype B HIV-1 infection [subtypes A, C, D, F, and G, and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) CRF01-AE and CRF02\_AG]. An additional 105 gag sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database were also analyzed. Extensive length variation was observed in the p6 gag region. Specific patterns of insertions and deletions were observed in different subtypes and CRFs, and no two subtypes or CRFs had the same general pattern. PTAP duplications were more common in subtype C than other strains (3 of 14 in subtype C vs. 2 of 113 in other strains, p = 0.004), and KQE duplications were seen only in subtype B. Further studies are needed to determine whether such genotypic differences influence viral replication capacity, antiretroviral drug susceptibility, or other phenotypic properties of these strains.},
