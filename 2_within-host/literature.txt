# notes for replication slippage 

- hamburgh et al 2006 
    - -1 frameshifting is a common artifact in HIV reverse transcriptase 

- viguera et al 2001
    - slippage involved DNA polymerase pausing 
    - pausing polymerase dissociates from the DNA 
    - resumption of replication then introduces the slippage and

    - modeled using a linear birth and death process 

- guglietta et al 2009/2010 Virology 
    - glycan shield evolves in response to continuously changing landscape of immunological pressures
    - V4 in particular is a hotspot for glycosylation sites 
    - all the variable loops, V4 for one, is made highly variable due to insertion and deletion events 
    - indels in V4 are essentially ALWAYS multiples of 3, preventing stop codons (Castro et al 2008, Belair et al. 2009)
    - V4 exists as a swarm of variants, constantly replenishing as parts of it are wiped out by antibody targeting 
    - misalignment during DNA synthesis occurs most frequently in areas containing repeats and
