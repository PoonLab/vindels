# Notes - Replication Slippage 

- hamburgh et al 2006 
    - -1 frameshifting is a common artifact in HIV reverse transcriptase 

- viguera et al 2001
    - slippage involved DNA polymerase pausing 
    - pausing polymerase dissociates from the DNA 
    - resumption of replication then introduces the slippage and

    - modeled using a linear birth and death process

    - glycan shield evolves in response to continuously changing landscape of immunological pressures
    - V4 in particular is a hotspot for glycosylation sites 
    - all the variable loops, V4 for one, is made highly variable due to insertion and deletion events 
    - indels in V4 are essentially ALWAYS multiples of 3, preventing stop codons (Castro et al 2008, Belair et al. 2009)
    - V4 exists as a swarm of variants, constantly replenishing as parts of it are wiped out by antibody targeting 
    - misalignment during DNA synthesis occurs most frequently in areas containing short, highly similar / repetitive sequences 
    - based on this model, indels occur at specific sequences 
    - TRENDS 
        - overall: indels in V4 appear to be the result of duplication events 
        - duplications occurring in the C terminal end of V4 tend to be short, non-specific repeats of like bases
            - AAGGT, ATC, AAT  
        - N terminal side 
            - a 15-mer (consensus ACAACAAAACTGT  bp7383-7397 of HXB2) was duplicated in 3/12 patients 
            - a 9-mer (consensus AGTACTTGG bp 7401-7409 of HXB2) was duplicated in 8/12 patients 
        - AAT trinucleotides were consistently found at indel breakpoints, inside of indels
            - IMPORTANT because AAT codes for N (start of an N-glyc site)
            - supporting the rearrangement of PNG sites (glycan shield)

    - streisingers "strand-slippage hypothesis" 
        - indels are generated from strand slippage of repetitive DNA sequences that create intermediates containing more or fewer bases

# Notes - Within host HIV evolutionary rates 

- Alizon 2013 ; [link](https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-10-49)
    - withinhost and between host evolutionary rates across HIV genome 
    - withinhost rates are found to be an order of magnitude higher than between host rates 
    - based on data retrieved from ENV:
        - within host is roughly 10<sup>-2 
        - between host is roughly 10<sup>-3</sup>
