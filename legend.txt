Figure 1. Rates of insertion/deletion events (indels) in the five gp120 variable loops of seven major HIV-1 subtypes. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to the determine the rate of indel events in each variable region of each subtype. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval within which the indel rates were estimated. Statistically different rates and groups of rates relative to mean estimates are indicated by (*) symbols and arrows indicating the directionality of difference.
